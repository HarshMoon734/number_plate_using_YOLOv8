Here's a well-structured README for your Number Plate Recognition using YOLOv8 project:

🚗 Number Plate Recognition using YOLOv8 🔍
This project implements Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) using YOLOv8 for real-time number plate detection and OCR for text extraction. It can process both images and videos, making it suitable for traffic surveillance, toll systems, and security applications.

📌 Features
✅ YOLOv8-based number plate detection (accurate and fast)
✅ OCR for text extraction (Tesseract-based recognition)
✅ Works on images & videos (real-time inference)
✅ Custom dataset training support (improve accuracy with your own data)
✅ Lightweight & efficient pipeline

🚀 Installation
1️⃣ Clone the repository

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/number-plate-recognition.git
cd number-plate-recognition
2️⃣ Install dependencies

bash
Copy
pip install ultralytics opencv-python pytesseract numpy
3️⃣ Download YOLOv8 model

bash
Copy
yolo download model=yolov8n.pt
(Or use yolov8s.pt for a more accurate model.)

📂 Usage
🔹 Detect number plates in an image
bash
Copy
python main.py --source path/to/image.jpg
🔹 Detect number plates in a video
bash
Copy
python main.py --source path/to/video.mp4
🔹 Real-time detection using a webcam
bash
Copy
python main.py --source 0
(Replace 0 with your webcam index if needed.)

🔬 Model Training (Custom Dataset)
If you want to train YOLOv8 on a custom dataset, follow these steps:

1️⃣ Prepare a dataset in YOLO format (images + .txt annotations).
2️⃣ Train the model:

bash
Copy
yolo train model=yolov8n.pt data=config.yaml epochs=50 imgsz=640
(Replace config.yaml with your dataset config file.)

🖼️ Example Results
(Add images/videos of detected number plates here.)

⚡ Future Improvements
 Improve OCR accuracy with pre-processing techniques
 Deploy as a web app or mobile app
 Integrate with a database for logging detections
🛠️ Technologies Used
🔹 Python (main programming language)
🔹 YOLOv8 (Ultralytics) (object detection)
🔹 OpenCV (image processing)
🔹 Tesseract OCR (text recognition)
